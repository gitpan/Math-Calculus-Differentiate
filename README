Math::Calculus::Differentiate version 0.3.0
===========================================

Math::Calculus::Differentiate takes an algebraic expression (e.g. in
the form x^2 + 5*x + sin(x)), differentiates it and returns the
derivative in the same format (e.g. 2*x + 5 + cos(x)). In understands
the operators +, -, *, / and ^ (raising to a power) as well as the
functions sin, cos, tan, sec, cosec, cot, sinh, cosh, tanh, sech,
cosech, coth, asin, acos, atan, asinh, acosh, atanh, ln and exp.
Functions are valid either side of all operators - that is, you can
differentiate a function raised to the power of another function.
Partial differentiation is supported to the extent that you can
differentiate with respect to a single variable.
